# Who?
_huh_ was conceptualized by [secret pizza party](https://secretpizza.party) and brought to life by the amazing [Dan Hauk](https://danhauk.com/).

# What?
_huh_ is the best way to offer in dashboard documentation for all your WordPress projects. The content is generated from a markdown file which makes it super quick & easy to update your documentation whenever you want.

# Where?
We think _huh_ is awesome and we really want you in use it in all your projects. It's totally free/open source and you can find it on [github](https://github.com/secretpizzaparty/huh/). 

# Why?
[secret pizza party](https://secretpizza.party) is in the process of developing a bunch of new WordPress themes and while they are quite simple there is still a need for a wee bit of documentation. External documentation is dumb and everything should be contained in the dashboard. We created _huh_ to make that happen.
